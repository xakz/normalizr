I was tired to escape character when I use the terminal (my main tool), so I
wrote this piece of software to normalize my filenames.

It replaces non ASCII characters to ASCII equivalents or by a filling
letter. Also, it removes characters that need to be escaped in your favorite
terminal emulator. It can also remove parentheses pairs with or without their
content.

Other normalizing features are planned like CamelCasing, removing of useless
words commonly found in downloaded filenames.
